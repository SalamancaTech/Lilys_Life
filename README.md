LILY'S LIFE | V7: THE IDENTITY UPDATE

Project Architect: Delilah
Core Philosophy: "The Pilot & The Vehicle: Adaptation is Power."

01. PROJECT OVERVIEW

The Lily's Life V7 engine shifts the narrative focus from basic survival to high-performance Social Strategy and Identity Calibration. The player (The Pilot) is tasked with synchronizing the protagonist (The Vehicle) with a volatile, scrutinizing world. Every choice, from a lace thong to a steel-toed boot, has quantifiable mechanical repercussions. The core challenge is managing perception and physical stability within the constraints of Lilith's Lake society.

The entire world structure is now a Single Source of Truth (SSOT), where all locations and items are governed by a comprehensive, mechanically explicit TAG_LIBRARY.

02. CORE MECHANICS: THE ENGINE ROOM

The game state is governed by a dual system of Resources and Attributes.

A. THE TANKS (Fluid Resources: 0–100)

These dictate Lily's moment-to-moment capacity to act, endure, and interact.

VITALITY (The Battery): Raw physical energy and metabolic stability.

Drain Vectors: Exertion, Thermal Debt (Heat/Cold), and Restrictive Clothing.

Critical State (0-10): Locks [BOLD] and [PLAYFUL] Stances.

COMPOSURE (The Social Health): The integrity of the persona; ability to suppress panic and handle pressure.

Drain Vectors: Social Scrutiny (Outfit Mismatch), High Visibility/Spotlight, and Failure.

Critical State (0-10): Locks [SHARP] and [ELEGANT] Stances.

SYNC (The Pilot Rating): How intuitive Lily's movement and presentation feel (0-100).

Low Sync (0-40): Impairs GRACE checks and leads to a sense of clusmsiness.

High Sync (41-100): Unlocks fluidity and grants [EUPHORIA] (Composure regeneration).

B. THE PENTAGRAM (Core Attributes: 1–10)

Five persistent stats used for all skill checks and Stance selections.

WILL (The Spine): Domain is Force, Boundaries, and Endurance. Key Stances are [COMMANDING] and [STOIC].

GRACE (The Flow): Domain is Coordination, Etiquette, and Harmony. Key Stances are [ELEGANT] and [DEMURE].

WIT (The Lens): Domain is Logic, Banter, Observation, and Deception. Key Stances are [SHARP] and [CRYPTIC].

HEART (The Pulse): Domain is Empathy, Connection, and Sincerity. Key Stances are [SINCERE] and [NURTURING].

FLAIR (The Spark): Domain is Projection, Drama, and Attention Capture. Key Stances are [BOLD] and [MYSTERIOUS].

03. THE WARDROBE PHYSICS ENGINE

Clothing is a complex layer of protection, vulnerability, and social compliance, filtered through the environment's tags.

EXPOSURE (The Vulnerability Index):

Calculated by the sum of outfit tags (e.g., [MINI], [CROP]).

High Exposure leads to High VISIBILITY and high FREEZE RISK.

THERMODYNAMICS (The Comfort Zone):

The Comfort Zone is 40–70.

The FREEZE STATE (below 30) causes negative modifiers to GRACE and VITALITY.

The OVERHEAT STATE (above 80) causes negative modifiers to VITALITY and applies the [MESSY] tag.

SOCIAL SCRUTINY (The Lock):

Triggered by Outfit Context Mismatch (e.g., [TRASHY] in a [LUXURY] zone).

The penalty locks high-confidence options and drains COMPOSURE.

VPL (Visible Panty Line Risk):

Calculated by the compatibility between the inner and outer bottom layers.

Risk results in critical failure in social or romantic scenarios.

SOCIAL DYNAMICS:

Location tags like JUDGMENT_ZONE, FLIRTY_ZONE, or MASCULINE_SPACE modify the difficulty of social Attribute checks.

The JUDGMENT_ZONE specifically increases the severity of the SOCIAL SCRUTINY penalty.

04. INTERACTION & RESOLUTION

A. THE INTERACTION MATRIX

All player actions combine an INTENT (Goal) with a STANCE (Delivery) selected from the Pentagram. The core action library (LOOK, TAKE, USE, TALK) has been standardized for object interaction.

Example: INTENT: CHARM + STANCE: [DEMURE] (Grace)

B. THE GAMBIT SYSTEM

When an Attribute Check fails by a narrow margin, the player may use a GAMBIT—a last-ditch resource sacrifice to force a success.

Example: Failed Social Check? Burn 20 COMPOSURE to laugh off the awkwardness and save the conversation.

05. CORE NARRATIVE CAST

MITCH: The Anchor / The Shield

Archetype: The Guardian Bear.

Role: Physical Protector. Operates on Trust (0-100).

Dynamic: Over-protective, values honesty and stability.

Synergy: [SINCERE] (Heart) and [DEMURE] (Grace). Grants Aura of Safety (halts Visibility accumulation).

ASHLEY: The Stylist / The Chaos Engine

Archetype: The Digital Witch.

Role: Social/Digital Strategist. Operates on Affinity (0-100).

Dynamic: Analytical, cynical, thrives on chaos. Sees social life as a hackable system.

Synergy: [SHARP] (Wit) and [BOLD] (Flair). Grants The Scanner (reveals NPC/Object tags).

06. THE WORLD STRUCTURE (16 HUBS & SSOT)

The world is a Single Source of Truth (SSOT) comprising 16 major Hubs and over 50 unique, explicitly tagged Sub-Locations. Locations now apply instantaneous status effects (Tags) which are guaranteed to be "sticky" and non-bleeding due to the fixed inheritance hierarchy.

All residences are global [SAFE_ZONE] hubs where Visibility is locked at 0% and Composure regenerates.

Lily's Residence (2B): The Sanctuary / The Cockpit. Key actions: Wardrobe UI, Sync Check.

Mitch's Residence (2A): The Bear's Den / The Anchor. Key objects: Resource Hub, Mitch NPC (Trust Builder).

Ashley's Residence (2C): The Digital Nest / The Chaos. Key objects: Streaming Rig (High Visibility Event), Ashley NPC (Style Audit).

Utility & Commerce: Expanded World areas featuring zones like [RESTROOM] (Hygiene/Composure), [FOOD_SOURCE] (Vitality), and [VIP_ACCESS] (Progression/Checks).
